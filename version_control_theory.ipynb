    "Commit Often\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequent commits ensure that your changes are saved incrementally, making it easier to track progress and identify where things might have gone wrong. Each commit should represent a logical unit of work, such as a completed query or a fixed bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write Meaningful Commit Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "A commit message should clearly describe the changes made. This helps others (and your future self) understand the purpose of the changes without having to read through the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches allow you to work on different features or fixes independently. For example, you might have a main branch for stable code and separate branches for new features or experiments. Once a feature is ready, it can be merged into the main branch. Use clear and consistent branch names for SQL scripts, such as feature/{short-description} for new queries or modifications, bugfix/{issue-description} for fixes, refactor/{script-name} for optimizations, and release/{version-number} for versioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularly Push Changes to Remote Repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "Pushing changes to a remote repository like GitHub ensures that your work is backed up and accessible to others. It allows team members to review your work, contribute, and merge updates in real time. Regular pushes prevent loss of work due to local machine failures, and keep everyone aligned with the latest changes, improving transparency and reducing conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Review and Test Before Merging\n",
    "\n",
    "Before merging changes from a branch into the main branch, create a pull request (PR) to allow team members to review the code. This provides an opportunity for feedback, identifies potential issues, and ensures the new code aligns with project standards. Additionally, review and test the code to ensure it doesn't introduce errors. This practice reduces the risk of deploying faulty code and improves overall collaboration by encouraging discussions and suggestions before the final merge.\n",
